# ðŸ“„ LiveText-Android

Welcome to our open-source project on GitHub! I am excited to introduce you to my latest project, LiveText for Android. It does the same job as LiveText on iOS and Google Lens. LiveText allows users to select and copy text directly from images, enhancing app interactivity and convenience.

## About

I developed a LiveText prototype app for Android as part of my seminar research on OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

I chose Java for this app simply because I wanted to use Java! ðŸ˜„â˜• You can easily integrate this into your Kotlin app due to Kotlin's interoperability with Java.

## Need Your Contribution

- [ ] Currently, it only supports line selection, but we aim to extend it to character selection too.
- [ ] Selecting multiple lines is not yet supported.
